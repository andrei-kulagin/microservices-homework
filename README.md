# microservices-homework
Well, as of now there are several points implemented in this homework:
- Discovery Service : Eureka
- Load Balancer : Ribbon
- Draft Service for API Gateway

If there is some time to continue to introduce other services 
I'd like to do so during this week (17 - 23 Feb) as I don't have much spare time to compete HW completely.

What I've learned (tech perspective, experience, theory):
- Eureka configuration and high level understanding how it works
- How to configure Ribbon
- Just started to dig deeper regarding Spring Cloud Gateway
- Yaml configurations
- Modules and hierarchies in terms of POMs configuration (it's pity but I spent some time fighting with that)
- Learnt some alternative technologies to those I knew beforehand (e.g. alternatives for Circuit Breaker pattern)
- refreshed knowledge about how JWT works
- revised some non functional aspects of microservices style
- revised knowledge about SOA and microservices comparisons
- knew a bit more about docker compose and K8S
- revised knowledge about choreography vs orchestration
- tons of Spring Cloud services - just general awareness - now need to practice
